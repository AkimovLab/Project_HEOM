The working files and examples from HEOM in Libra are contained here.
## HEOM Tutorial
This Jupyter notebook serves as a tutorial for generating both population dynamics and absorbance spectra using the HEOM method.
## Comparative Analysis
This Jupyter notebook illustrates how the different bath characteristics affect the population dynamics. It both calculates the population dynamics and plots the results.
## Seven state system
The population dynamics of a seven level system is calculated using HEOM. The parameters of the system were obtained from
